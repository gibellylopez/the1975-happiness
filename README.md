# The 1975 Happiness

> Show me your love, Why don't you?

## What is this? 
*"Happiness" is a song recorded by English band the 1975. It was released on 3 August 2022 as the second single from their fifth studio album, Being Funny in a Foreign Language (2022).

* I chose to promote this song because it's a current favorite. Although it is very simple, there is a lot of details (much like the song) that can be appreciated. 

* 5 words to describe this song are Uplifting, Energetic, Catchy, Melodic, Nostalgic. 

* Much like the albums creative direction, there is a lot of monchrome black and white imagery which can seem very moody. I used some ambient gradient tones to express some of that energetic and catchy energy while still keeping the original visuals.

## CSS Styling
* I went with an overall more clean and minimal design much like the concepts the band often uses, highlighting the tone of their music.

* The text is styled with Reddit Mono; distinctive monospaced font , providing a modern and clean look.

* The color palette is simple, predominantly using white for the background and black for the text, ensuring high readability. I also used an accent color of a light brown color to inject some color besides b/w.

* I used padding and margins creates a spacious feel, preventing the content from appearing cluttered.

* The highlight of my Single Song Promo would have to be the lyrics changing color when hovering over the line. I thought it was a fun addition that could help with readability and following along with the song!
